TIMSS 2015 AUSTRALIAN YEAR 8 DATA

The TIMSS data are complex and require particular procedures for merging, weighting etc. 
Therefore, it is highly recommended that you obtain a copy of the supporting documentation for the International Database
in order to get the most out of the data.  The supporting documentation is available at:
http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-database/

The data contained in the files accompanying this file are the Australian data.  
For the most part these data are the same as that contained in Australian files within the International Database. 
However these data files also contain some extra national variables and, where applicable, national options for items have 
been detailed in the variable and/or value labels.
 
The information below details the national variables not available in the international versions of the Australian data, 
but made available in these files, as well as those international items that have national options or country-specific terminology.

PLEASE NOTE: For ease of use the following international terms have been modified to the Australian context wherever they occur:
